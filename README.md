# Installation Instructions: 
  It uses a Node server and React. You will need to npm install in the main folder and then npm install again in the client folder. After that npm start from the main folder should bring everything up.

# Usage Info: 
  You are good to use the website. If you download my code for use, you will need MongoDB and a digital editor (I use Visual Studio Code). It should be implied that a basic working knowledge of those will be needed too.

# Contributing Guidelines: 
  I welcome ideas on improving this. Feel free to reach out through GitHub.

# Testing Info: 
  I don't have anything set up through a testing environment. Just the basics verification of your basic mad programmer. Example: "What do you mean I can't use 'Date.now'?"
